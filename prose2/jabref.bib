  abstract   = {This paper proposes a mechanism for equation-based congestion control for unicast traffic. Most best-effort traffic in the current Internet is well-served by the dominant transport protocol, TCP. However, traffic such as best-effort unicast streaming multimedia could find use for a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism that refrains from reducing the sending rate in half in response to a single packet drop. With our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, where a loss event consists of one or more packets dropped within a single round-trip time. We use both simulations and experiments over the Internet to explore performance.},

  abstract = {Recent years mesh-based Peer-to-Peer live streaming has become a promising way for service providers to offer high-quality live video streaming service to Internet users. In this paper, we make a detailed study on modeling and performance analysis of the pull-based P2P streaming systems. We establish the analytical framework for the pull-based streaming schemes in P2P network, give accurate models of the chunk selection and peer selection strategies, and organize them into three categories, i.e., the chunk first scheme, the peer first scheme and the epidemic scheme. Through numerical performance evaluation, the impacts of some important parameters, such as size of neighbor set, reply number, buffer size and so on are investigated. For the peer first and chunk first scheme, we show that the pull-based schemes do not perform as well as the push-based schemes when peers are limited to reply only one request in each time slot. When the reply number increases, the pull-based streaming schemes will reach close to optimal playout probability. As to the pull-based epidemic scheme, we find it has unexpected poor performance, which is significantly different from the push-based epidemic scheme. Therefore we propose a simple, efficient and easily deployed pushâ€“pull scheme which can significantly improve the playout probability.},

  abstract   = {Several peer-to-peer systems for live streaming have been recently deployed (e.g. CoolStreaming, PPLive, SopCast). These all rely on distributed, epidemic-style dissemination mechanisms. Despite their popularity, the fundamental performance trade-offs of such mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this paper we propose several results that contribute to the understanding of such trade-offs.Specifically, we prove that the so-called random peer, latest useful chunk mechanism can achieve dissemination at an optimal rate and within an optimal delay, up to an additive constant term. This qualitative result suggests that epidemic live streaming algorithms can achieve near-unbeatable rates and delays. Using mean-field approximations, we also derive recursive formulas for the diffusion function of two schemes referred to as latest blind chunk, random peer and latest blind chunk, random useful peer.Finally, we provide simulation results that validate the above theoretical results and allow us to compare the performance of various practically interesting diffusion schemes terms of delay, rate, and control overhead. In particular, we identify several peer/chunk selection algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance trade-offs. Moreover, we show that the control overhead needed to implement these algorithms may be reduced by restricting the neighborhood of each peer without substantial performance degradation.},
