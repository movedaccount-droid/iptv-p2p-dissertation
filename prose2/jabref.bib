Most best-effort traffic in the current Internet is well-served by the dominant transport protocol, TCP. However, traffic such as best-effort unicast streaming multimedia could find use for a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism that refrains from reducing the sending rate in half in response to a single packet drop. With our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, where a loss event consists of one or more packets dropped within a single round-trip time. We use both simulations and experiments over the Internet to explore performance.},

  abstract = {Recent years mesh-based Peer-to-Peer live streaming has become a promising way for service providers to offer high-quality live video streaming service to Internet users. In this paper, we make a detailed study on modeling and performance analysis of the pull-based P2P streaming systems. We establish the analytical framework for the pull-based streaming schemes in P2P network, give accurate models of the chunk selection and peer selection strategies, and organize them into three categories, i.e., the chunk first scheme, the peer first scheme and the epidemic scheme. Through numerical performance evaluation, the impacts of some important parameters, such as size of neighbor set, reply number, buffer size and so on are investigated. For the peer first and chunk first scheme, we show that the pull-based schemes do not perform as well as the push-based schemes when peers are limited to reply only one request in each time slot. When the reply number increases, the pull-based streaming schemes will reach close to optimal playout probability. As to the pull-based epidemic scheme, we find it has unexpected poor performance, which is significantly different from the push-based epidemic scheme. Therefore we propose a simple, efficient and easily deployed push–pull scheme which can significantly improve the playout probability.},

  abstract   = {Several peer-to-peer systems for live streaming have been recently deployed (e.g. CoolStreaming, PPLive, SopCast). These all rely on distributed, epidemic-style dissemination mechanisms. Despite their popularity, the fundamental performance trade-offs of such mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this paper we propose several results that contribute to the understanding of such trade-offs.Specifically, we prove that the so-called random peer, latest useful chunk mechanism can achieve dissemination at an optimal rate and within an optimal delay, up to an additive constant term. This qualitative result suggests that epidemic live streaming algorithms can achieve near-unbeatable rates and delays. Using mean-field approximations, we also derive recursive formulas for the diffusion function of two schemes referred to as latest blind chunk, random peer and latest blind chunk, random useful peer.Finally, we provide simulation results that validate the above theoretical results and allow us to compare the performance of various practically interesting diffusion schemes terms of delay, rate, and control overhead. In particular, we identify several peer/chunk selection algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance trade-offs. Moreover, we show that the control overhead needed to implement these algorithms may be reduced by restricting the neighborhood of each peer without substantial performance degradation.},

  abstract   = {Several peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming systems have proved by now their ability to deliver live video streams to hundreds of users. However the inherent instability of the distribution environment poses several obstacles for these systems to manage to deliver a high quality experience to the end users. In this paper we explore node churn which independently of the distribution topology adopted, is an ''anomaly'' to the operation of the system leading to the degradation of playout quality. We argue that node churn is service specific and that churn in a P2P streaming service is highly correlated to the quality experienced at each node. On this basis we contribute a novel churn model to capture this twofold relationship and reveal unknown till now interactions while operating popular peer selection strategies under node churn. We provide evidence that selection strategies aiming solely at either efficiency or stability of a connection, although efficient for other P2P services such as P2P file sharing, lead to the formation of distribution topologies that are highly sensitive to node churn resulting in degraded performance. We propose a peer selection strategy designed to be P2P streaming service specific that takes decisions in short time scales while balances several factors such as connection efficiency, connection stability and content availability. It is proved that this approach achieves a uniform development of the distribution topology and leads to superior performance in terms of both low node churn and increased experienced quality.},

  abstract = {A robust real-time video communication service over the Internet in a distributed manner is an important challenge, as it influences not only the current Internet structure but also the future Internet evolution. In this context, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are playing an imperative position for providing efficient video transmission over the Internet. Recently, several P2P video transmission systems have been proposed for live video streaming services or video-on-demand services over the Internet. In this paper, we describe and discuss existing video streaming systems over P2P. Efficient (delay tolerant and intolerant) data sharing mechanisms in P2P and current video coding trends are elaborated in detail. Moreover, video streaming solutions (live and on-demand) over P2P from the perspective of tree-based and mesh-based systems are explained. Finally, the conclusion is drawn with key challenges and open issues related to video streaming over P2P.},

  abstract = {Relying on end users to contribute bandwidth to the system peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays provide a cheap and scalable way to distribute live video content in the Internet. However, being inherently dynamic due to peers joining and leaving the system at arbitrary time and running over the best-effort Internet, successful commercial usage of these systems may suffer from unstable media quality provided to end users. In this survey, we consider problems related to providing quality of media delivery in P2P streaming systems. We show that in spite of numerous systems available today no one incorporates mechanisms capable to maintain a certain level of quality of delivered media. We identify reasons behind that and discuss possible solutions to this problem.},

  abstract = {Coolstreaming is a mesh based peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming system in which single video stream is decomposed into multiple sub-streams. A client-peer node retrieves the sub-streams from multiple parent-peer nodes, combining them into the original video stream. Each client-peer node has two buffers, a synchronization buffer and a cache buffer, and arriving data blocks are synchronized at the synchronization buffer and then forwarded to the cache buffer. In this buffering system, data-block synchronization is important to guarantee high video quality. In this paper, we consider the effect of churn on the performance of data-block synchronization scheme with which data blocks are simultaneously forwarded just after all the data blocks composing a macro data block arrive at the synchronization buffer. It is assumed that data blocks belonging to a sub-stream arrive at the client-peer node according to an interrupted Poisson process. The synchronization buffer is modeled as a multiple-buffer queueing system with homogeneous interrupted Poisson processes, and the mean forwarding interval is derived. Numerical examples show that the average forwarding interval increases as parent-peer nodes leave more frequently.},
