1. download and unpack omnet 5.4.2
https://omnetpp.org/download-items/omnetpp/omnetpp-542.html

2. install dependencies. i installed everything available
from both the current version of the install guide and the
guide that comes with the download
https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf

3. make and install via configure
./configure WITH_OSG=no WITH_OSGEARTH=no

4. add omnet "bins" folder to path

5. attempt to launch omnet. if needed, update ide config

6. download and unpack inet and oversim to any location
https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/releases/tag/v3.6.8
https://github.com/inet-framework/oversim/releases/tag/v20190424

7. open omnet. when prompted, do not automatically install inet
or any other options.

8. file -> import -> general -> existing into workspace -> next
-> select your unpacked inet directory -> finish

9. repeat for oversim directory

10. ctrl+b to check initial build

11. copy the contents of this directory:
oversim-20190424/src/overlay/coolstreaming
oversim-20190424/simulations/omnetpp.ini

12. hit f11 or run with omnetpp.ini focused in the editor. select
"coolstreaming" to run

this will work for up to 50s before hitting memory errors.
you will need to enable tkenv for any further sims, though
i don't remember how to do that. sorry!
